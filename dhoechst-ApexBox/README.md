Box API for Force.com
=====================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dhoechst/ApexBox/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dhoechst/ApexBox/latest)

2015-12-16: Box has released an official version of the [SDK for Salesforce](https://github.com/box/box-salesforce-sdk/tree/master/src). I highly recommend you use that project.

[Deploy to Salesforce](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com/?owner=dhoechst&repo=ApexBox)

This project provides a wrapper for the Box API for integration with Salesforce.
