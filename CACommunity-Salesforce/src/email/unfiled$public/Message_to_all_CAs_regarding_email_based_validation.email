Subject: [cabfman] New 'attack' / 'risk' vector for e-mail validation (including based on WHOIS)
Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2015 16:33:22 -0700
From: Ryan Sleevi

Greetings all,

A user recently reported through our browser security reporting mechanism a validation problem for CAs that perform e-mail based validation. This primarily affects those that use email addresses derived from WHOIS information or sources other than the set of whitelisted emails.

It appears several member CAs are failing to properly handle e-mail addresses, leading to unauthorized parties being able to approve certificate issuance.

Consider, for example, a WHOIS contact information for a domain of "user+word@example.com" or "user=word@example.com". Both of these email addresses conform to the rules set out in RFC 822 with respect to the 'localpart' syntax.

It appears, when authorizing the issuance, CAs are sending emails to "word@example.com", rather than to the full "user+word@example.com" / "user=word@example.com", allowing the attacker (who obtains "word@example.com") to cause and obtain certificates for example.com.

I'd request that CAs work with their engineering departments to ensure they are not vulnerable to such attacks, and that their systems properly handle such cases, as well as handling productions such as quoted-string, as also detailed in RFC 822 and subsequent RFCs. This is especially important as EAI addresses (described in RFC 6530 and related) come into play.
