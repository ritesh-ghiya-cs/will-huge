Dear {!Lead.Salutation}  {!Lead.LastName},

Thinking about attending the upcoming Gartner CIO &amp; IT Executive Summit, 4-5 June, in Berlin?

Collaboration as an Enabler of Change

How to make sense of the multitude of options  available to enterprise organisations when developing a robust solution for  collaboration as part of a wider UC strategy. What implications should be considered of legacy solutions when building for the future. How to build sustainable and flexible solutions ready  for
deployment and fit for the future

Attend Gartner CIO &amp; IT Executive Summit and see how to leverage new tools, technologies and trends to the fullest within the DACH region. Validate   your strategy and approach, exchange best practices with peers and   spark new ideas.

We look forward to seeing you in June!
