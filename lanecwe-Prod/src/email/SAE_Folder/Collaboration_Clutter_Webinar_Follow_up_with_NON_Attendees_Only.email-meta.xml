{!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for registering your interest in our last webinar and sorry you couldn&apos;t join us. Our presenters spoke about some interesting topics including: how to upgrade your services whilst dealing with the complexities of having a legacy system in place, bringing on new products and services whist keeping your existing collaboration services running and finally how you can build sustainable solutions today with all the tools and techniques available to share with your customers tomorrow.

Our next webinar titled &apos;Equipping an Increasingly Mobile Workforce Webinar&apos; is due to take place June 24th. Featured stories and topics include: Rethinking BYOD, Analysing Devices, Controlling Applications and The Human Element.
