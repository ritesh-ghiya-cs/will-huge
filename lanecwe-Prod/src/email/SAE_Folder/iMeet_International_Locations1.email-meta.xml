    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Just wanted to follow up with you to let you know the countries that are included in your iMeet minutes:


Belgium
Canada
France
Germany
Hungary
Ireland
Israel
Italy
Portugal
Singapore
Spain
and the UK


So anytime iMeet calls you or one of your guests within the US or within these countries there is no charge (up to 10,000 minutes).  Dial out isn&apos;t just convenient - It is great feature for savings!


If you go over 10,000 minutes per month you are charged per minute...and if you call other countries you will be charged per minute as well.  The costs are on your agreement - or let me know which countries and I will get them for you.


Best wishes,



Susan A. Porter
