{!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for reading our research brief, Fighting the Forgetting Curve. One stat from Aberdeen’s research that jumped out at me was that sales productivity (based on an average deal size per month) increased $39,000 when video meetings were used in the companies surveyed. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how incorporating video meetings and video demos can shorten sales cycles and help you meet your quotas.

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
