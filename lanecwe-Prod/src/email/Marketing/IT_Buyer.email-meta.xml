{!Lead.FirstName},

Have you seen an increased use of tablets in the workplace? If so, you may be interested in this recent study from Forrester on this emerging trend and the impact that adding web conferencing tools to tablets can have on collaboration and communication. Click here to read the research: Adding Webconferencing Tools To Tablets Fosters Mobile Collaboration.

One stat from Forrester’s research that jumped out at me was that 72% of tablet users report that meeting access  — either getting everyone into a meeting or participating in a meeting away from a desktop or laptop — is the main stumbling block to using webconferencing at their companies. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how the right meeting technology — either on the go or at your desk — can help you save costs and time.

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
