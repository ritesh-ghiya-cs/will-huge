    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Recently, one of our top sales managers, Michael Lopez, presented an AA-ISP webinar on the topic of Virtual Sales Presentations That Win. After hearing Michael’s tips for using video technology for sales calls, approximately 89% of the polled audience said that they’d want to use video technology for sales presentations or external meetings.

I’d like to talk with you about the effectiveness of video meetings in your sales calls, and will be in touch shortly to discuss further.

Best regards,
