MANAGE YOUR BUSINESS DAY WITH THIS
COOL MOBILE APP

We&apos;ve all been there…scrambling at the last minute to join a meeting when you&apos;re driving to the kid&apos;s sporting event, just leaving a customer appointment or standing in the forever security line at the airport.

Stop the scrambling! With the Agenday app, you can  instantly connect to all of your meetings without even opening your calendar.


Agenday scrapes your calendar to alert you when you have a meeting. Simply touch the phone icon and you&apos;ll automatically connect to the conference.  Running late? Click the email icon to notify the participants. It&apos;s a real time saver.


Check out this video to see why Agenday is the best business calendar app on the market — or  go to www.agenday.com.
