{!Lead.FirstName},

I&apos;m writing today to share this research brief from the Aberdeen Group on the power of incorporating video into sales meetings. As a sales leader, I thought this research would be of interest to you: Video and Collaboration: Fighting the Forgetting Curve. One stat from this brief that jumped out at me was that sales productivity (based on an average deal size per month) increased $39,000 when video meetings were used in the companies surveyed. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how incorporating video meetings and video demos can shorten sales cycles and help you meet your quotas.

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
