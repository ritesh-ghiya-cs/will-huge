MEETINGS ON-THE-GO
YOU&apos;RE BUSY &amp;ndash; SO WE MADE MEETINGS SIMPLE 

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Need flexible meeting options for the way you work? With GlobalMeet you can meet at your desk or on-the-go with our GlobalMeet mobile apps.  http://pages.pgi-email.com/gm-web-tools/

With GlobalMeet Mobile Apps you can:

	- Start, schedule and join your meeting directly from your mobile device
	- Host, record and present directly from your iPad
	- Have the meeting call you with GlobalMeet&apos;s &apos;Connect Me&apos; feature
Don&apos;t let meetings keep you down &amp;ndash; now you can break the chain from your desk and meet when and where you want.
