    <textOnly>PGi, the Meetings Experts

{!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for reading our whitepaper, Why Online Video is Changing the Candidate Engagement Model. In a recent HR.com webinar, Kevin Wheeler explained how video can be used throughout the recruiting process, from the initial candidate assessment to onboarding new employees. He even went so far to say “Video is the most significant thing to happen to recruitment in the next 2 to 3 years.” I&apos;d like to talk to you about how the right meeting technology can help you assess candidates faster, and find the &quot;right&quot; person for the role.

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
