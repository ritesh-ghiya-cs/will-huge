    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for visiting with Soundpath during this year’s LMA conference in Las Vegas. We wanted to take this opportunity to reintroduce ourselves. Have questions about how Soundpath can improve your team’s collaboration and productivity? We’d like to hear from you! Please feel free to call me at {!User.Phone} for a free evaluation of your current webinar/web conferencing/webcasting portfolio.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
