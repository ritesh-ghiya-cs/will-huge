YOUR ONE SOURCE

FOR ALL THE WAYS YOU NEED TO MEET

  

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As your PGi account manager, I want to introduce you to all the services that we currently provide your company, and share useful information like:


 
	- How to get the most out of your audio conferencing service and take advantage of all the features available with your account
	- Which web and video conferencing options are available for you to use when you need to really engage your participants
	- Who to contact if you need a PGi Event Specialist to set-up and host a large meeting, event or webcast
	- Where you can find online resources for training &amp; support 
 Do you have 15 minutes?

I&apos;d like to learn more about your needs so I can recommend some specific solutions. I will call to get some time on your calendar and you are welcome to contact me at your convenience.


Regards,
