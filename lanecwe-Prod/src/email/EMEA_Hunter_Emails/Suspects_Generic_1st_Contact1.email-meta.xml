    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
Did you know that in the past 10 years, BYOD has increased 4X among enterprise organizations? With the continuing growth of remote workers and the exponential rise of mobility, a new landscape for modern business collaboration is here to stay.
In working with over 40,000 customers worldwide and 75% of the Fortune 100™,  PGi has found 3 key challenges common to enterprise organizations:

-iPads, tablets and smartphones integrating into existing technology platforms (BYOD)

-High cost and low usage of video telepresence rooms versus the ease of use of HD video conferencing tools

-Fragmented approach of current audio, web and video conferencing solutions

PGi enables companies to consolidate their entire organization&apos;s audio, web and video conferencing needs making it easier to meet anywhere, anytime and on virtually any device.

I&apos;d like the opportunity to share with you how PGi&apos;s award winning collaboration solutions can meet your needs. Please let me know your availability for a 15-minute virtual meeting by contacting me at the information below; otherwise I will follow up with you next week.
