    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to introduce myself and my organisation PGi as the leading global collaboration experts.

By way of introduction, PGi proudly serves over 40,000 enterprise customers worldwide and 75% of the Fortune 100™. Our products bring together best-in-class video, web and audio conferencing cloud based solutions that are easy-to-use and always available.

As we work with many of the NHS’s industry partners we are acutely aware of the many challenges currently facing your organisation and the UK health sector. Our affordable virtual meeting products enable organisations to beat the trends by driving costs down and improving productivity.

The NHS Institute has highlighted some of the key advantages of adopting our services

More engaging than phone or email as provides visual information as well as being a truly two-way interaction.
Helps to avoid long distance travel to specialist units or for patients living in remote areas
Cost savings in terms of travel and time

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate how PGi can help your sales team become more productive and would like to book a 60 minute meeting to learn more about your meeting requirements – I have some great ideas we want to share with you!

I will contact you shortly to arrange a convenient time or alternatively contact me using the details below.

Yours sincerely
