Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

PGi’s dedicated Event Management Team will tailor the perfect meeting for you.

PGi Event Services offer a personal, professional meet-and-greet service to connect your participants to your conference call.
Online tools will let you know exactly who would like to ask a question and you will be able to prioritise the order in which you take them.
Technicalities are taken out of your hands so you can focus on the content and prepare for your Q&amp;A session.


A pre-call consultation ensures that all of your communication objectives are captured. After the call , your dedicated Event Manager will provide you with a full participant list, transcription and recording.

I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about your large meetings and event requirements - I have some great ideas we want to share with you!

I will contact you shortly to arrange a convenient time.

Yours sincerely

{!Contact.FirstName},
