    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to introduce myself as a PGi Collaboration Expert.

By way of introduction, PGi is a global provider that currently manages event conferencing for 75 of the fortune 100.  I currently work with many companies within your industry and wanted to bring to your attention our suite of services.

At PGi we have a global sales team and understand the importance of being able to meet with your client face to face whilst also having the ability to share content, and demonstrate products and services. PGi’ s mobile apps also mean that your participants can join anytime, anywhere and from any device.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate how PGi can help your sales team become more productive and would like to book a 60 minute meeting to learn more about your meeting requirements – we have some great ideas we want to share with you!

I will contact you on Monday to arrange a convenient time.

Yours sincerely

{!Contact.FirstName},
