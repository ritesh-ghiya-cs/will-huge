You are receiving this email as you received 1 or more emails from Salesforce.com earlier today in error.  This is only for any emails with the Subject line of &quot;Your Salesforce Opportunity has been reviewed by IST&quot; AND that were sent from Matt Santy. You can ignore these email(s) as they pertain to an Opportunity that was reviewed in the past.  Apologies for any confusion.


Thanks,
