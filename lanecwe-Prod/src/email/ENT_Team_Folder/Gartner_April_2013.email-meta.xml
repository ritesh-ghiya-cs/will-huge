    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:


Please join PGi at this yearâ€™s Gartner PCC conference at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego on April 29-May 1 as we discuss groundbreaking new communication and collaboration trends for enterprises. We will be hosting on-site iMeet and GlobalMeet demos in Booth 118. Be sure to stop by for a special gift as well, before the goodies are gone.


Jan Correll, Vice President of Global Sales at PGi will be available for meetings if you are interested in having a more in depth discussion.  Let me know and I will set up a meeting.


Looking forward to seeing you there !
