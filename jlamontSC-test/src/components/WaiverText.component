          <li>Wildlife viewing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Personnel: Activities may be provided, assisted, or led by various types of people (e.g., employees, volunteers, contractors) who may not be under Sierra Club&#39;s influence or control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settings: Activities occur in many settings (e.g., indoor, outdoor; in urban, suburban, rural, remote, or wilderness areas; in the U.S. and abroad); and at a variety of facilities or premises (e.g., lodges, huts, or other accommodations that may or may not be owned or controlled by Sierra Club).
        </p>
        <p>
          Services: Services (e.g., food service, lodging, equipment, supplies, and transportation) may be provided by Sierra Club, contractors, or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travel: Participants may travel in a variety of ways (e.g., airplanes, vans, buses, taxis, cars, or other vehicles; chairlifts, boats, bikes, on foot; or by riding horses or other animals.) Participants may travel or carpool in vehicles not owned, evaluated, or controlled in any way by Sierra Club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free time/Supervision: Participants (including minors) may have free, unscheduled, or unsupervised time (e.g., before, during, or after activities; while traveling to or from a program; alone or with other participants, leaders, volunteers, or others).
        </p>
        <p>
          INHERENT RISKS. Some, but not all, of the inherent risks participants may face include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weather: Participants may be subject to storms, including rain, lightning, snow or ice; mist or fog; 
            extremely humid or dry air; extreme heat or cold; and rapid, extreme, or unpredictable weather changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Terrain: Participants may be exposed to high altitudes; mountainous, wilderness, glacial, or desert 
            terrain; steep slopes; uneven, slippery, muddy, rocky, icy, snowy, or otherwise difficult terrain; 
            flash floods, rock- or mud-slides, avalanches; collapsing snow, earth, or other structures; 
            falling rocks, trees, branches, or other objects; routes or pathways obstructed by fallen trees 
            or otherwise; difficult river crossings; and other natural or man-made hazards 
            (both on land and above and below water level), which may not be marked or visible. 
            Activities may take participants off marked trails or known routes into land or waters with which 
            leaders are unfamiliar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water: Any program may bring participants in contact with bodies of water. Activities involving water 
            pose risks such as slipping on wet surfaces; falling, jumping, or diving into the water; hitting submerged 
            objects or the bottom of a river, pool, or other water body; being swept into or carried away by the 
            water; experiencing a boat capsize or collision; confronting rapids, fast-moving water, waterfalls, holes, 
            and reversals; submerged or above-water obstacles (e.g., boulders, trees, or fences); rough seas, 
            challenging tides, strong currents, waves, reefs or whitewater; very cold or deep water; getting caught 
            or entangled in objects above or below water; or encounters with dangerous marine life, rocks, coral, or 
            caves. Water may be contaminated. SCUBA diving includes additional risks (e.g., breathing at high 
            pressures, extreme pressure changes, loss of buoyancy control, inadequate or contaminated air or oxygen).
          </li>
          <li>
            Orientation: Participants, or their group, could become lost, disoriented, or separated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Climbing: Climbers may slip or trip and fall partway or all the way to the ground; lose a grip; be hit by 
            rock, ice, debris, objects, or people falling from above; or confront loose or damaged climbing holds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ropes: Participants could experience burns, pinches, jolts, or entanglement; hit a rock face, grip, 
            climbing tower, cable, object, or person; or develop excessive speed while descending.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plants and animals: Participants may be exposed to stinging, sharp, venomous, or disease-carrying 
            land and water animals, insects or microorganisms; poisonous plants; or close and unpredictable contact 
            with wild or domestic animals. Both wild and domestic animals may behave in sudden or unexpected ways 
            such as biting, kicking, bucking, running, or stepping on or running into participants or things.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools, safety gear, and equipment: Tools, safety gear, and other equipment (e.g., participant&#39;s own 
            equipment; Sierra Club equipment; or purchased, borrowed, or rented equipment) may break, fail, or 
            malfunction. Participants assume full responsibility for the selection, fit, and condition of their 
            equipment. Sierra Club or its contractors may recommend or require safety gear for some activities. 
            Safety gear may prevent or lessen injuries in some instances, but does not guarantee safety or prevent 
            all injuries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transportation: Planes, trains, cars, buses, canoes, kayaks, rafts, bikes, sleds, skis, and the like may 
            swerve, flip, capsize, or crash. Road, water, or air conditions may be dangerous. Transportation may fail, 
            or may not arrive or depart on time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Food and drink: Food and drinks provided by Sierra Club, vendors, contractors, restaurants, or others 
            run the risk of contamination or allergic reaction. Items to which a participant is allergic may not be 
            identified. Water in streams or other bodies, or improperly treated tap water, may be contaminated 
            (e.g., with bacteria, parasites, chemicals, or viruses). Alcoholic beverages may be present in some 
            settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Premises: Premises managed by Sierra Club or others may have any number of defects (e.g., slippery 
            walkways; uneven floors or ground, or defective flooring; missing or inadequate railings; improperly 
            built or marked steps or stairways; defective electric or power systems; hot surfaces or scalding water; 
            open or broken windows; vermin; missing or defective smoke or other detectors or fire extinguishers; or 
            improperly stored poisonous or flammable materials).
          </li>
          <li>
            Judgment: Sierra Club, the participant, and others, must make judgments and decisions in a variety of 
            environments, based on a variety of perceptions and evaluations. Sierra Club, the participant, or others 
            may err in judgment, or make poor decisions (e.g., they may misjudge the capabilities, health, or 
            physical or mental condition of the participant or others; or misjudge or make poor decisions regarding 
            some aspect of preparation, travel, instruction, medical condition or treatment, weather, environment, 
            terrain, water conditions or water level, natural hazards, travel routes, location, or direction).
          </li>
          <li>
            Carelessness or misconduct: Sierra Club may be careless in any aspect of the activities. Participant or 
            third parties (e.g., other participants, contractors, or emergency personnel) could act inappropriately or 
            carelessly, or engage in negligent, reckless, or willful misconduct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volunteers: Sierra Club is largely a volunteer organization, and many activities are led or assisted by 
            volunteers (including participants). They are not professional guides or leaders, and may not have the 
            same level of skill and experience that a professional would have.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suitability: Participating in activities may present additional risks due to a participant&#39;s mental, 
            physical or emotional condition (e.g., participant&#39;s fitness level, level of maturity, or use of alcohol or 
            prescription or non-prescription drugs), whether the condition is disclosed or undisclosed, known or 
            unknown. Participant (and parent of a minor), in conjunction with their physician, should consider 
            carefully whether Sierra Club activities are appropriate for participant. Participant and parent of a minor 
            assume full responsibility for selecting programs and activities that are suitable in light of participant&#39;s 
            condition, as well as his or her abilities, preferences, and perceptions. Programs may be rated as to their 
            difficulty, and Sierra Club may screen participants for suitability. However, ratings and screenings are 
            often subjective, may not be accurate or consistent, and may not reflect the level of difficulty participant 
            will experience. Participants should use ratings or screenings as only one point of information in 
            selecting a program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Individual Functioning: Participant or others (e.g., other participants, the leader, or a contractor) may 
            overestimate his or her own abilities or fitness; be inattentive; lose his or her balance or footing; trip or 
            fall; lose control of a horse or other animal; not understand the functioning of (or misuse) tools, 
            chemicals, or equipment; fail to negotiate steep, uneven or difficult terrain; not control his or her speed; 
            use equipment improperly; or practice improper hygiene. Participant may be injured when these things 
            happen to him or her, or when they happen to someone else and participant is affected. Participant (or 
            parent of a minor) is responsible for ensuring that the participant has appropriate skills, physical 
            conditioning, equipment and supplies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fires, Explosions, and Hazardous Materials: Participants tending to, cooking over, or being near a 
            campfire or a gas, propane, or other stove (e.g., while camping or staying in a hostel) are subject to the 
            risk of explosion, scalding or other burns, or smoke inhalation. Participants may be exposed to 
            hazardous materials (e.g., a service project may involve the use of paints or cleaning agents) whose use 
            or misuse can cause chemical poisoning or other injury.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remoteness: Activities may take place in remote locations, several hours or days from medical 
            facilities, causing potential delays or difficulties in communication, transportation, evacuation, or 
            medical care. Wireless communication devices may not work. Medical facilities may be primitive, 
            inadequate, or inaccessible. Circumstances may require transportation from a foreign country to the 
            U.S. or another country for medical care.
          </li>
          <li>
            Travel abroad: Foreign travel can involve exposure to different customs and behaviors; plants, 
            animals, insects, bacteria, and diseases that may be rare or unknown in the U.S.; contaminated food or 
            water; dangerous road or travel conditions; political unrest, riots, or warfare. Participants may be 
            subject to laws and legal systems that do not provide the same protections as in the United States. 
            Medical, rescue, and other services may not meet U.S. standards. Sierra Club is not expert at assessing 
            the risks of travel abroad. Participant (or parent) is solely responsible for evaluating such risks and 
            deciding whether to go and what precautions to take (e.g., vaccinations), and is encouraged to consult 
            the U.S. Department of State (www.travel.state.gov), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
            (www.cdc.gov), World Health Organization (www.who.int), a physician, and other sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Terrorism, Criminal Behavior, and Epidemics: Acts of terrorism, criminal conduct (e.g., thievery, 
            banditry, abduction, or drug-related activities), and epidemics can occur in any location.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          HARMS. The inherent risks and other risks can result in harms. Some, but not all, of the harms a 
          participant may incur include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allergic reactions, bites, stings, and contact irritation;</li>
          <li>Cuts, abrasions, bruises, sunburn, chemical burn, rope burn, or other burns;</li>
          <li>Soft tissue injuries (e.g., strains, sprains, tears, and inflammation of tendons, ligaments, and muscles);</li>
          <li>Illnesses, infections, and diseases (e.g., animal- or insect-borne diseases, contagious maladies and viruses);</li>
          <li>Gastrointestinal problems;</li>
          <li>
            Injuries related to heat, cold, exertion, and/or drinking inadequate or excessive amounts of water 
            (e.g., hypothermia [dangerously low body temperature], hyperthermia [dangerously high body 
            temperature], hyponatremia [salt imbalance], frostbite, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or dehydration);
          </li>
          <li>Injuries related to high altitudes (e.g., pulmonary or cerebral edema [fluid in the lungs or brain]);</li>
          <li>Drowning; SCUBA injuries (e.g., barotraumas, gas embolisms, decompression sickness [&quot;the bends&quot;], nitrogen narcosis);</li>
          <li>Broken bones, concussions, wounds, complications or injuries relating to the bodily organs or any other part of the body;</li>
          <li>Mental or emotional trauma;</li>
          <li>Property theft, damage, or loss; and/or</li>
          <li>Paralysis, impairment, disability, coma, or death.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF INHERENT AND OTHER RISKS. By signing below, I (participant, or parent for myself and on behalf of my participating child acknowledge that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The activities can cause participant or others any of the harms above, or other harms.</li>
          <li>
            I have reviewed all program information that has been provided to me; and I will review any 
            additional program information I receive. I acknowledge that Sierra Club representatives have been 
            available to answer any questions I may have about the activities, risks, and potential harms.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that the information provided by Sierra Club (in this document or otherwise) may be 
            inaccurate or incomplete, and may reflect incorrect risk assessments or judgments. Unplanned activities 
            may arise in the course of a program, and unknown or unanticipated risks and harms may exist. Sierra 
            Club cannot assure participant&#39;s safety or eliminate the risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I am signing as the parent of a minor participant, I give permission for my child to participate in all 
            activities, and will discuss the activities and risks with my child.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          PARTICIPANT IS VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN THE ACTIVITIES WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE RISKS. 
          PARTICIPANT (AND PARENT OF A MINOR) FULLY ASSUMES AND ACCEPTS THE INHERENT RISKS AND

          (including claims of Sierra Club&#39;s negligence):

        <p>
          1) brought by or on behalf of me (or my child), or by or on behalf of any other person (including family

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Participant can and will participate without harming him/herself or others; and will contribute 
            constructively to the group&#39;s well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will accurately complete all required forms, abide by their terms and all applicable laws, 
            and obey all Sierra Club rules and policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sierra Club contracts with independent contractors (who are not its employees or agents) to provide 
            or conduct a variety of services and activities. Sierra Club does not supervise or control these 
            contractors and is not responsible or liable for their conduct.
          </li>
          <li>
            I authorize Sierra Club leaders, contractors, or others, including medical personnel, to obtain or 
            provide medical care for me/my child, to transport me/my child to a medical facility, and to provide 
            treatment they consider advisable for my/my child&#39;s health. I agree to pay all associated costs. I 
            authorize the release of my medical records and personal information by or to Sierra Club, if necessary 
            or useful for treatment, referral, billing, or insurance purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I sign this agreement as a parent or guardian, and my parental status or authorization to sign on my 
            child&#39;s behalf is challenged or found invalid, I will not sue, and will indemnify and defend, Sierra Club to 
            the fullest extent allowed by law and this agreement, just as if I were the participant&#39;s parent or 
            guardian. I will also indemnify and defend Sierra Club against any claims, by any person or agency, that 
            take the position that my signature was not effective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sierra Club reserves the right to dismiss a participant for any reason, or for no reason, in its sole 
            discretion (e.g., a leader may dismiss a participant s/he believes presents a safety concern or medical 
            risk, is disruptive, or otherwise conducts him or herself in a manner detrimental to the activities). If 
            participant is dismissed or departs for any reason, participant (or parent of a minor) is responsible for all 
            costs of this early departure (e.g., evacuation, medical treatment, plane or other transportation, and 
            expenses for any Sierra Club representative accompanying participant).
          </li>
          <li>
            The program begins and ends at the times and places officially designated by Sierra Club. I am fully
            responsible for myself/my child during transportation to and from the program. In addition, if a
            participant chooses to spend time with Sierra Club leaders or others before or after the program, 
            participant does so independently and entirely at his or her (or the parent&#39;s) own risk.
